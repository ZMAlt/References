abstract = {Abstract The emergence of state-of-the-art satellite altimetry has provided new prospects for integrating water surface elevation (water level) measurements with a hydrologic model for river discharge estimation, which is particularly suited for poorly gauged or ungauged basins. In this context, we explored the possibility of model calibration using Jason-2-derived water levels, followed by SWOT (the Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission)-like data (the combination of Landsat 5/8-derived at-a-section river widths and concurrent gauged water levels). Two types of empirical formulas designed specifically for altimetry-derived water levels and the joint use of water levels and river widths, respectively, were used to derive discharge, which was integrated with a hydrologic model (CREST-RS). Here we present results of estimating daily continuous river discharge in narrow rivers for the upper Brahmaputra River (UBR) and Lhasa River (LR) using the developed approach independent of in situ discharge measurements. Five scenarios were performed: (1) model calibration using the Jason-2-derived water levels and SWOT-like data in the UBR (scenarios I–III) and (2) model calibration using the SWOT-like data for the LR (scenarios IV–V). Results showed that model calibration using the Jason-2-derived water levels could provide reasonably well-constrained parameters for discharge estimation, with the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient (NSE) reaching 0.85 during 2003–2014. For the SWOT-like data, the NSE reached 0.85 for the UBR and 0.75 for the LR. This study highlights the potential of performing model calibration using satellite altimetry and SWOT-like observations, which paves the way to estimate river discharge for ungauged basins globally.},

abstract = {Abstract The Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will launch in early 2022 to provide the first global inventory of terrestrial surface water. Although SWOT is primarily a research mission with key science objectives in both the oceanography and hydrology domains, SWOT data are expected to have application potential to address many societal needs. To identify SWOT applications, prepare for the use of SWOT data, and quantify SWOT impacts prior to launch, realistic proxy SWOT observations with representative measurement errors are required. This paper provides a step-by-step description of two methods for deriving proxy SWOT water surface elevations (WSEs) from an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) using the Weather Research and Forecasting hydrological extension package (WRF-Hydro). The first, a basic method, provides a simple and efficient way to sample WRF-Hydro output according to the SWOT orbit and add random white noise to simulate measurement error, similar to many previous approaches. An alternate method using the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) Large-Scale SWOT Hydrology Simulator accounts for additional sources of measurement error and produces output in formats comparable to that expected from official SWOT products. The basic method is ideal for river hydrology applications in which a full representation of SWOT measurement errors and spatial resolution is unnecessary, whereas the CNES simulator approach is better-suited for more rigorous scientific studies that require a comprehensive error budget.},

abstract = "Water surface elevation (WSE), slope and width measurements from the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will enable spaceborne estimates of global river discharge. WSE will be measured by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). InSAR measurements are vulnerable to contamination from layover, a phenomenon wherein radar returns from multiple locations arrive at the sensor simultaneously, rendering them indistinguishable. This study assesses whether layover will significantly impact the precision of SWOT estimates of global river discharge. We present a theoretical river layover uncertainty model at the scale of nodes and reaches, which constitute nominal 200 m and 10 km averages, respectively, along river centerlines. The model is calibrated using high-resolution simulations of SWOT radar interaction with topography covering a total of 41,233 node observations, across a wide range of near-river topographic features. We find that height uncertainty increases to a maximum value at relatively low values of topographic standard deviation and varies strongly with position in the swath. When applied at global scale, the calibrated model shows that layover causes expected height uncertainty to increase by only a modest amount (from 9.4 to 10.4 cm at the 68th percentile). The 68th percentile of the slope uncertainty increases more significantly, from 10 to 17 mm/km. Nonetheless, the 68th percentile discharge uncertainty increases only marginally. We find that the impact of layover on SWOT river discharge is expected to be small in most environments."

abstract = {Abstract The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite will provide global observations of surface water storage and river discharge at an unprecedented high resolution and accuracy after its scheduled launch in 2021, but a limitation of SWOT observations is their spatial and temporal discontinuity associated with the SWOT orbital characteristics. Here, we describe a prototype data assimilation framework to assimilate synthetic SWOT water surface elevation observations into the LISFLOOD-FP hydrodynamic model to generate a spatially and temporally continuous SWOT discharge data product. We develop the assimilation system with realistic errors in both the SWOT observations and model predictions. During a 3-year period (consistent with the designed SWOT mission life), the assimilation effectively fills the observation gaps in both time and space across the 5,094-km Upper Mississippi river network, where SWOT observations provide an average spatial sampling coverage of 55\%. The assimilation results in a posterior discharge estimate agree well with the synthetic truth and better capture the peak flows in the significant 1993 flooding in this region; the daily posterior discharge estimates collectively increase the accuracy of the open-loop (model-only) discharge estimate by 41\%. The posterior estimates show the largest improvement in areas where SWOT has higher sampling frequency and spatial sampling density and where the river has larger volumetric water storage. The accuracy improvement from the assimilation of SWOT data persists well between subsequent observations. Correcting the effects of bathymetric errors on hydrodynamic modeling prior to the assimilation is critical for the assimilation to improve discharge estimates.},
