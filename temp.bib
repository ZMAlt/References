	abstract = {Marine gravity anomaly derived from satellite altimetry can be computed using either sea surface height or sea surface slope measurements. Here we consider the slope method and evaluate the errors in the slope of the corrections supplied with the Jason-1 geodetic mission data. The slope corrections are divided into three groups based on whether they are small, comparable, or large with respect to the 1 microradian error in the current sea surface slope models. (1) The small and thus negligible corrections include dry tropospheric correction, inverted barometer correction, solid earth tide and geocentric pole tide. (2) The moderately important corrections include wet tropospheric correction, dual-frequency ionospheric correction and sea state bias. The radiometer measurements are more preferred than model values in the geophysical data records for constraining wet tropospheric effect owing to the highly variable water-vapor structure in atmosphere. The items of dual-frequency ionospheric correction and sea state bias should better not be directly added to range observations for obtaining sea surface slopes since their inherent errors may cause abnormal sea surface slopes and along-track smoothing with uniform distribution weight in certain width is an effective strategy for avoiding introducing extra noises. The slopes calculated from radiometer wet tropospheric corrections, and along-track smoothed dual-frequency ionospheric corrections, sea state bias are generally within ±0.5 microradians and no larger than 1 microradians. (3) Ocean tide has the largest influence on obtaining sea surface slopes while most of ocean tide slopes distribute within ±3 microradians. Larger ocean tide slopes mostly occur over marginal and island-surrounding seas, and extra tidal models with better precision or with extending process (e.g. Got-e) are strongly recommended for updating corrections in geophysical data records.},

	abstract = {An optimal procedure is developed for deriving gravity anomalies from sea-surface height measurements obtained by a number of different satellites, the inclinations of which may vary. We begin by recasting the problem of the conversion of the deflection of the vertical to gravity in the frequency domain. We show that a deterministic approach based on the Vening-Meinesz integral is equivalent in the frequency domain to the stochastically based method of least-squares collocation. A new method for gridding the deflection of the vertical is developed that uses the fact that satellite tracks of the same type (ascending or descending) are nearly parallel, so that values at grid points can be estimated by first performing along-track interpolations, followed by one cross-track interpolation, both using Akima's spline. This gridding method is very efficient compared with methods such as that of fitting minimum curvature surfaces, especially for dense data such as for the 168 day cycles of ERS-1. A weighted leastsquares method is then employed to obtain the north and east components of deflectionof-the-vertical components using the gridded along-track components from all of the individual satellite missions. Finally, gravity anomalies are computed from the two deflection-of-the-vertical components in the frequency domain with truncated kernel functions, the use of which is related to the prior removal of a high-degree reference gravity field. This new procedure is more than 100 times faster than least-squares collocation, and yields gravity anomalies with errors that are comparable to those derived by least-squares collocation and smaller than those derived by other recent applications of spectral techniques, as judged by comparisons with ship-gravity measurements. The case of gravity computation for a single altimetric satellite is handled separately, and a method is given to estimate the noise spectra of deflection of the vertical and reduce the numerical problems caused by satellites with high inclination angles. The new procedures make possible quick, yet accurate, global updates of the marine gravity field.},

Compared to an older gravity field that did not include the new altimeter data, incoherent power is reduced globally by approximately 2.9 dB at 15 km, 1.6 dB at 20 km, and 1.0 dB at 25 km wavelengths. Coherence analyses between the updated gravity and recent multibeam surveys distributed throughout the world’s oceans shows an average increase of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde0.023 in mean coherence in the 20–160 km waveband, with the biggest increase ({\textbackslash}textgreater0.08) over fast spreading ridges and smallest ({\textbackslash}textless0.02) over slow spreading ridges and continental shelves. The shortest wavelength at which coherence is above 0.5 decreased globally by {\textbackslash}textasciitilde2 km wavelength, with the biggest decrease ({\textbackslash}textgreater3.5 km) over fast spreading ridges and smallest ({\textbackslash}textless1.5 km) over slow spreading ridges and continental shelves. In the Clipperton fracture zone area these improvements result in seamounts that are more accurately located, the detection of smaller seamounts, and the expression of north-south trending abyssal hill fabric. As more altimeter data from the ongoing satellite missions are incorporated into future gravity field updates, finer-scale details of the seafloor will continue to emerge.},

	abstract = {High-precision and high-resolution gravity ﬁelds can be derived from multi-source satellite altimeter data. A gravity anomaly model around the South China Sea (SCSGA) V1.0 on a 1 × 1 grid is established from sea surface heights (SSHs) of several geodetic missions (GMs) and exact repeat missions. Gridded deﬂections of the vertical are ﬁrst calculated from SSHs by the least squares collocation (LSC) method and then used to derive gravity anomalies by the inverse Vening Meinesz formula. In gravity derivation processing, we establish an approximate relationship among the precision of altimetric gravity, precision of geoid gradients, and density of geoid gradients (the average number of geoid gradients per 1 × 1 region). The weights of geoid gradients from the Ka-band altimeter for the LSC are innovatively determined by an iterative method. Finally, SCSGA V1.0 is assessed by ship-borne gravity anomalies and marine gravity models. The performance of GMs in gravity derivation is evaluated. In general, the altimetric gravity precision in regions with many islands and reefs increases more obviously than those in other regions when the geoid gradient density increases. The standard deviation of SCSGA V1.0 is 2.78 mGal, which is slightly better than those of four recognized global marine gravity models around the SCS. CryoSat-2 is the most important dataset for SCSGA V1.0. Ka-band SARAL/AltiKa plays a major role in gravity derivation, and the contribution of Haiyang-2A is greater than those of other Ku-band satellites, except CryoSat-2. SCSGA V1.0 is concluded to reach an international advanced level for marine gravity from altimeter data around the SCS.},

This paper aims at modeling a regional marine gravity field with improved accuracy and higher resolution (1′×1′) over Southeastern China Seas using additional data from CryoSat-2 as well as new data from AltiKa. Three approaches are used to enhance the precision level of satellite-derived gravity anomalies. Firstly we evaluate a suite of published retracking algorithms and find the two-step retracker is optimal for open ocean waveforms. Secondly, we evaluate the filtering and resampling procedure used to reduce the full 20 or 40Hz data to a lower rate having lower noise. We adopt a uniform low-pass filter for all altimeter missions and resample at 5Hz and then perform a second editing based on sea surface slope estimates from previous models. Thirdly, we selected WHU12 model to update the corrections provided in geophysical data record. We finally calculated the 1′×1′ marine gravity field model by using EGM2008 model as reference field during the remove/restore procedure. The root mean squares of the discrepancies between the new result and DTU10, DTU13, V23.1, EGM2008 are within the range of 1.8–3.9mGal, while the verification with respect to shipboard gravity data shows that the accuracy of the new result reached a comparable level with DTU13 and was slightly superior to V23.1, DTU10 and EGM2008 models. Moreover, the new result has a 2mGal better accuracy over open seas than coastal areas with shallow water depth.},

	abstract = {The traditional altimetry satellite, which is based on pulse-limited radar altimeter, only measures ocean surface heights along tracks; hence, leads to poorer accuracy in the east component of the vertical deflections compared to the north component, which in turn limits the final accuracy of the marine gravity field inversion. Wide-swath altimetry using radar interferometry can measure ocean surface heights in two dimensions and, thus, can be used to compute vertical deflections in an arbitrary direction with the same accuracy. This paper aims to investigate the impact of Interferometric Radar Altimeter (InRA) errors on gravity field inversion. The error propagation between gravity anomalies and InRA measurements is analyzed, and formulas of their relationship are given. By giving a group of possible InRA parameters, numerical simulations are conducted to analyze the accuracy of gravity anomaly inversion. The results show that the accuracy of the gravity anomalies is mainly influenced by the phase errors of InRA; and the errors of gravity anomalies have a linear approximation relationship with the phase errors. The results also show that the east component of the vertical deflections has almost the same accuracy as the north component.},

	abstract = {Abstract Accurate estimate of ocean surface currents is both a challenging issue and a growing end-users requirement. In this paper ocean currents are calculated at two levels (surface and 15 m depth) as the sum of the geostrophic and Ekman components. First, a new, global, ° Mean Dynamic Topography, called the CNES-CLS13 MDT, has been calculated and is now available for use by the oceanographic community. By exploiting information from surface drifters and Argo floats, the new MDT resolves spatial scales beyond the resolution permitted by the recent Gravity and Ocean Circulation Experiment (GOCE) geoid models (125 km). Associated mean geostrophic speeds in strong currents are increased by 200\% on average compared to GOCE-based mean currents. In addition, for the first time, a two-level, monthly, empirical Ekman model that samples a spiral-like behavior is estimated. We show that combining both pieces of information leads to improved ocean currents compared to other existing observed products.},

	title = {Performance {Analysis} of {Ocean} {Surface} {Topography} {Altimetry} by {Ku}-{Band} {Near}-{Nadir} {Interferometric} {SAR}},
	abstract = {Interferometric imaging radar altimeter (InIRA) is the ﬁrst spaceborne Ku-band interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) which is specially designed for ocean surface topography altimetry. It is on the Tiangong II space laboratory, which was launched on 15 September 2016. Different from any other spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR), InIRA chooses a near-nadir incidence of 1◦{\textbackslash}textasciitilde8◦ in order to increase the altimetric precision and swath width. Limited by the size of the Tiangong II capsule, the baseline length of InIRA is only 2.3 m. However, beneﬁtting from the low orbit, the signal-to-noise ratio of InIRA-acquired data is above 10 dB in most of the swath, which, to a certain extent, compensates for the short baseline deﬁciency. The altimetric precision is simulated based on the system parameters of InIRA. Results show that it is better than 7 cm on a 5-km grid and improves to 3 cm on a 10-km grid when the incidence is below 7.4◦. The interferometric data of InIRA are processed to estimate the altimetric precision after a series of procedures (including image coregistration, ﬂat-earth-phase removal, system parameters calibration and phase noise suppression). Results show that the estimated altimetric precision is close to but lower than the simulated precision among most of the swath. The intensity boundary phenomenon is ﬁrst found between the near range and far range of the SAR images of InIRA. It can be explained by the modulation of ocean internal waves or oil slick, which smooths ocean surface roughness and causes the modulated area to appear either brighter or darker than its surroundings. This intensity boundary phenomenon indicates that the available swath of high altimetric precision will be narrower than expected.},

	abstract = {Conventional ocean-viewing radar altimeters (RA) have inherent limitations that become especially apparent when considering applications in the coastal environment. This chapter looks at three new technologies, two of which are to be on forthcoming missions: the delay-Doppler (or SAR mode) altimeter, to be embarked on CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3, and Alti-Ka, on India's SARAL mission (previously Oceansat-3). These instruments are nadir-viewing, each featuring a smaller footprint, improved tracking, and finer measurement precision. Wide swath techniques also are reviewed, represented by KaRIn. That concept offers altimetric coverage over an area that extends nominally 80 km to both sides of its nadir track. Relative to coastal applications, all three approaches have their respective advantages and limitations, highlighted in the discussion.},

The higher precision of these new sea surface height observations compared with observations from ERS-1 and Geosat results in a dramatic improvement of the shorter wavelength of the gravity ﬁeld (12–20 km) resulting in much favorable comparison with marine gravity. The pan-Arctic altimetric gravity ﬁeld now surpassing 2008 Arctic Gravity Field project derived from multiple gravity ﬁeld sources.
