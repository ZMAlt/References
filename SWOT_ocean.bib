abstract = "We use an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) to quantify improvements in ocean state estimation due to the assimilation of simulated Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) observations using a multi-scale 3DVAR approach. The sequential multi-scale assimilation first generates a large-scale analysis and then updates that analysis with smaller scale corrections. Since we use temperature and salinity depth profiles as proxies for sea surface height (SSH) observations, the results are idealized. Skill metrics consistently show that the multi-scale analysis is superior to the single-scale analysis, specifically because it improves small-scale skill without sacrificing skill at larger scales. The analysis skill over a range of spatial scales is determined using wavenumber spectral analysis of 100 m temperature, SSH, and mixed layer depth (MLD). For MLD, the multi-scale assimilation of SWOT data reduces the minimum constrained wavelength from 158 km to 122 km, a 36 km reduction, compared to a single-scale assimilation of the same data. For SSH, the multi-scale approach only reduces constrained scales from 73 km to 72 km, a 1 km reduction. This small increase in skill is caused by the steep wavenumber spectral slope associated with SSH, which suggests that SSH variability is concentrated at long wavelengths. Ultimately, the small-scale update in the multi-scale assimilation has less to correct for SSH. In contrast, MLD has a relatively flat spectral slope. The multi-scale solution can make a more substantial update to the MLD field because it has more small-scale variability. Thus, our results suggest that the magnitude of the skill improvement provided by the multi-scale solution is negatively correlated with the spectral slope of the ocean variable."

abstract = {Abstract We present a mapping methodology to improve the resolution of gridded sea surface height (SSH) from multisatellite along-track measurements, and apply it in the California Current system. This is motivated by the upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission, which will collect novel high-resolution wide-swath SSH measurements. The calibration/validation of SWOT will be in the California Current and requires independent observations of SSH spatial variability. Our objective was to discover how far we could push the space–time resolution of SSH maps based on the existing altimetry constellation. Currently, the best SSH maps for the region are from AVISO's global product based on optimal interpolation (OI). Our methodology is based on 2-D variational analysis (2DVAR), and we address some limitations of the AVISO OI global parameterization that restrict the resolution. Key improvements are (1) use of a background field incorporating mesoscale information, as opposed to a long-term mean field; (2) optimized regional parameters; and (3) a representation error term in the observational error covariance matrix to account for the spread of measurements in time. Using a suite of independent remote and in situ observations, we show the 2DVAR method can produce higher-resolution SSH maps in the California Current region that successfully capture smaller-scale ocean features than AVISO, at the expense of an increase in noise.},
